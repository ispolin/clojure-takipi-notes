# clojure-takipi-notes

A place to put tests and observations about using Takipi SAAS debugger with clojure.

## Affiliation and Accreditation

Please note that I am not in any way affiliated with Takipi team. This is an unofficial project that only demonstrates my experimentation with Clojure and Takipi. It should NOT be taken as official documentation from the Takipi team. Also, I did not have any part in the Takipi product; all credit for Takipi should go to the Takipi team.

## A note for the Clojure NYC user group

The slides form my July 2013 presentation can be found in the doc folder.

For those of you asking about Takipi's business model, looks like the plan is to charge monthly per server after the beta is over.

Many of you asked after the presentation if I was aware of any self-hosted solution Takipi plans to offer. They tweeted last month that they will likely have a self hosted solution in the future:
